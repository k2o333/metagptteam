# Document Adaptation Workflow - Implementation Summary

## Features Implemented

1. **ChangeCoordinator Role**
   - Analyzes document changes using LLM
   - Dispatches rewrite tasks to ChiefPM sequentially
   - Tracks task completion and signals workflow completion

2. **ChangeApplier Role**
   - Applies text changes to documents based on precise location information provided by AnalyzeChanges Action.
   - Ensures accurate text replacement by integrating with the RewriteSection Action.
   - Provides success/failure feedback to the ChangeCoordinator Role.
   - Handles both single-line and multi-line text replacements.
   - Maintains document context and structure during the replacement process.
   - Ensures consistency in formatting and style throughout the document.
   - Provides clear and concise feedback to ChiefPM on the completion status of each rewrite task.
   - Provides success/failure feedback

3. **AnalyzeChanges Action**
   - Uses LLM to identify specific sections that need modification
   - Provides precise location information (line/char indices)
   - Returns clear rewrite task descriptions

4. **RewriteSection Action**
   - Rewrites document sections based on specific instructions
   - Maintains document context and structure
   - Ensures consistency in formatting and style
   - Handles both single-line and multi-line text replacements
   - Provides clear and concise rewrite task descriptions to ChiefPM
   - Integrates with the ChangeApplier Role for accurate text replacement

5. **Workflow Integration**
   - Complete pipeline from document analysis to text replacement
   - Proper role coordination and message passing
   - Completion detection and signaling

## Current Status

✅ **Core functionality working:**
- Document analysis and change identification
- Task dispatching to appropriate roles
- Text replacement with location information
- Single task completion detection
- Workflow orchestration

⚠️ **Minor Issues to Address:**
- LLM sometimes provides incorrect line/character indices (0-based indexing confusion)
- Text replacement occasionally causes minor document corruption with duplicate content
- Multi-task completion detection needs refinement
- Minor text artifacts in replacement (e.g., "document.ument")
