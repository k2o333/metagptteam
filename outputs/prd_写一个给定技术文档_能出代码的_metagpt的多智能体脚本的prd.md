**Result**:

## Code Samples

This section provides example scripts and explanations to help you understand how to implement and interact with the MetaGPT multi-agent scripting framework. These samples cover various aspects of the framework, including agent definition, inter-agent communication, and integration with large language models (LLMs).

### 1. Defining Agent Roles and Hierarchies

#### Example Script: Agent Definition

```python
from metagpt import Agent, AgentRole

# Define agent roles
class TaskManager(AgentRole):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="TaskManager")

class WorkerAgent(AgentRole):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="WorkerAgent")

# Create agents with roles
task_manager = Agent(role=TaskManager())
worker_agent = Agent(role=WorkerAgent())

# Define hierarchical structure
task_manager.add_subordinate(worker_agent)
```

#### Explanation
In this script, we define two agent roles: `TaskManager` and `WorkerAgent`. We then create agents with these roles and establish a hierarchical structure where the `TaskManager` is the superior agent, and the `WorkerAgent` is its subordinate.

### 2. Inter-Agent Communication

#### Example Script: Message Passing

```python
from metagpt import Message

# TaskManager sends a message to WorkerAgent
message = Message(content="Start task 1", sender=task_manager, recipient=worker_agent)
task_manager.send_message(message)

# WorkerAgent processes the message
def process_message(agent, message):
    if message.content == "Start task 1":
        print(f"{agent.role.name} received message: {message.content}")
        # Perform task 1

worker_agent.receive_message(message, process_message)
```

#### Explanation
This script demonstrates how agents can communicate with each other using message passing. The `TaskManager` sends a message to the `WorkerAgent`, which then processes the message and performs the specified task.

### 3. Large Language Model Integration

#### Example Script: LLM Integration

```python
from metagpt import LLMIntegration

# Initialize LLM integration
llm = LLMIntegration(model_name="large-language-model")

# Define a prompt
prompt = "Translate the following text to French: 'Hello, world!'"

# Get response from LLM
response = llm.get_response(prompt)
print(f"LLM Response: {response}")
```

#### Explanation
This script shows how to integrate a large language model (LLM) into the MetaGPT framework. We initialize the LLM integration with a specific model and define a prompt. The LLM then processes the prompt and returns a response.

### 4. Prompt Engineering

#### Example Script: Prompt Design

```python
from metagpt import PromptEngine

# Initialize prompt engine
prompt_engine = PromptEngine()

# Design a prompt
prompt = prompt_engine.design_prompt(
    context="Customer support",
    question="How can I help you today?",
    constraints="Keep the response polite and professional"
)

# Get response from LLM
response = llm.get_response(prompt)
print(f"LLM Response: {response}")
```

#### Explanation
This script demonstrates how to design and refine input prompts using the `PromptEngine`. We specify the context, question, and constraints for the prompt, which is then sent to the LLM for processing.

### 5. Memory and Context Management

#### Example Script: Context Management

```python
from metagpt import ContextManager

# Initialize context manager

## 11. Code Samples

This section provides example scripts and explanations to help you understand how to implement and interact with the MetaGPT multi-agent scripting framework. These samples cover various aspects of the framework, including agent definition, inter-agent communication, and integration with large language models (LLMs).

### 1. Defining Agent Roles and Hierarchies

#### Example Script: Agent Definition

```python
from metagpt import Agent, AgentRole

# Define agent roles
class TaskManager(AgentRole):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="TaskManager")

class WorkerAgent(AgentRole):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="WorkerAgent")

# Create agents with roles
task_manager = Agent(role=TaskManager())
worker_agent = Agent(role=WorkerAgent())

# Define hierarchical structure
task_manager.add_subordinate(worker_agent)
```

#### Explanation
In this script, we define two agent roles: `TaskManager` and `WorkerAgent`. We then create agents with these roles and establish a hierarchical structure where the `TaskManager` is the superior agent, and the `WorkerAgent` is its subordinate.

### 2. Inter-Agent Communication

#### Example Script: Message Passing

```python
from metagpt import Message

# TaskManager sends a message to WorkerAgent
message = Message(content="Start task 1", sender=task_manager, recipient=worker_agent)
task_manager.send_message(message)

# WorkerAgent processes the message
def process_message(agent, message):
    if message.content == "Start task 1":
        print(f"{agent.role.name} received message: {message.content}")
        # Perform task 1

worker_agent.receive_message(message, process_message)
```

#### Explanation
This script demonstrates how agents can communicate with each other using message passing. The `TaskManager` sends a message to the `WorkerAgent`, which then processes the message and performs the specified task.

### 3. Large Language Model Integration

#### Example Script: LLM Integration

```python
from metagpt import LLMIntegration

# Initialize LLM integration
llm = LLMIntegration(model_name="large-language-model")

# Define a prompt
prompt = "Translate the following text to French: 'Hello, world!'"

# Get response from LLM
response = llm.get_response(prompt)
print(f"LLM Response: {response}")
```

#### Explanation
This script shows how to integrate a large language model (LLM) into the MetaGPT framework. We initialize the LLM integration with a specific model and define a prompt. The LLM then processes the prompt and returns a response.

### 4. Prompt Engineering

#### Example Script: Prompt Design

```python
from metagpt import PromptEngine

# Initialize prompt engine
prompt_engine = PromptEngine()

# Design a prompt
prompt = prompt_engine.design_prompt(
    context="Customer support",
    question="How can I help you today?",
    constraints="Keep the response polite and professional"
)

# Get response from LLM
response = llm.get_response(prompt)
print(f"LLM Response: {response}")
```

#### Explanation
This script demonstrates how to design and refine input prompts using the `PromptEngine`. We specify the context, question, and constraints for the prompt, which is then sent to the LLM for processing.

### 5. Memory and Context Management

#### Example Script: Context Management

```python
from metagpt import ContextManager

# Initialize context manager
context_manager = ContextManager()

# Add contextual information
context_manager.add_context(agent=worker_agent, context_info="Task 1 in progress")

# Retrieve contextual information
context_info = context_manager.get_context(agent=worker_agent)
print(f"Context Information: {context_info}")
```

#### Explanation
This script shows how to manage contextual information for agents using the `ContextManager`. We add contextual information for the `WorkerAgent` and then retrieve it to ensure coherent conversations.

### 6. Tool Use

#### Example Script: External Service Integration

```python
from metagpt import ToolIntegration

# Initialize tool integration
tool = ToolIntegration(service_name="WeatherAPI")

# Define a task
task = "Get the current weather in New York"

# Get response from external service
response = tool.get_response(task)
print(f"WeatherAPI Response: {response}")
```

#### Explanation
This script demonstrates how to integrate external services into the MetaGPT framework using the `ToolIntegration` class. We define a task and send it to the external service (e.g., WeatherAPI) to get a response.

These code samples provide a foundation for implementing and interacting with the MetaGPT multi-agent scripting framework. You can build upon these examples to create complex AI applications tailored to your specific use cases.
