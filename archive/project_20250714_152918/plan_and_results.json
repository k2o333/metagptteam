                "result": "### Setting Up a Basic AutoGen Application\n\nThis section will guide you through the process of setting up a basic AutoGen application, including code examples and detailed explanations.\n\n#### Step 1: Importing Required Modules\n\nFirst, you need to import the necessary modules from the AutoGen library. These modules provide the essential components for creating and managing agents, as well as setting up the GroupChat environment.\n\n```python\nfrom autogen import GroupChat, ChatManager, Agent\n```\n\n- **GroupChat**: This class is used to create a chat room where multiple agents can communicate.\n- **ChatManager**: This class manages the conversation within the GroupChat, ensuring that messages are delivered to the intended recipients.\n- **Agent**: This class represents an individual agent that can participate in the GroupChat.\n\n#### Step 2: Defining Agents\n\nNext, you need to define the agents that will participate in the GroupChat. Each agent can have unique capabilities, knowledge, and communication styles.\n\n```python\n# Define the agents\nagent1 = Agent(\"Agent1\")\nagent2 = Agent(\"Agent2\")\nagent3 = Agent(\"Agent3\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we are creating three agents named `Agent1`, `Agent2`, and `Agent3`. You can customize each agent by adding specific behaviors and responses.\n\n#### Step 3: Customizing Agent Behaviors\n\nYou can customize the agents by defining their behaviors and responses. For example, you can add a greeting behavior to `Agent1` and a response behavior to `Agent2`.\n\n```python\n# Customize agent behaviors\nagent1.add_behavior(\"greet\", lambda: \"Hello, I'm Agent1!\")\nagent2.add_behavior(\"respond\", lambda msg: f\"I received: {msg}\")\n```\n\n- **add_behavior**: This method allows you to add a specific behavior to an agent. The first argument is the name of the behavior, and the second argument is a lambda function that defines the behavior.\n\n#### Step 4: Creating a GroupChat Instance\n\nOnce the agents are defined and customized, you can create a GroupChat instance and add the agents to it.\n\n```python\n# Create a GroupChat instance\ngroup_chat = GroupChat(agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3])\n```\n\n- **GroupChat**: This class initializes a new chat room and takes a list of agents as an argument.\n\n#### Step 5: Creating a ChatManager Instance\n\nThe ChatManager oversees the conversation within the GroupChat. It manages message routing and maintains the context of the discussion.\n\n```python\n# Create a ChatManager instance\nchat_manager = ChatManager(group_chat=group_chat)\n```\n\n- **ChatManager**: This class initializes a new chat manager and takes a GroupChat instance as an argument.\n\n#### Step 6: Starting the Conversation\n\nWith the GroupChat and ChatManager set up, you can start the conversation and facilitate discussions among the agents.\n\n```python\n# Start the conversation\nchat_manager.start_conversation()\n```\n\n- **start_conversation**: This method initiates the conversation within the GroupChat.\n\n#### Step 7: Facilitating Discussions\n\nYou can facilitate discussions by sending messages through the ChatManager. For example, you can send a greeting message from `Agent1` and a response message to `Agent2`.\n\n```python\n# Facilitate discussions\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent1\", \"greet\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent2\", \"respond\", \"Hello, Agent2!\")\n```\n\n- **send_message**: This method sends a message to a specific agent.

                "result": "# Implementing Concurrent Multi-Expert Discussions Using GroupChat\n\n## Overview of GroupChat\n\nThe GroupChat feature in AutoGen is designed to facilitate concurrent discussions among multiple agents, enabling collaborative problem-solving, decision-making, and brainstorming. GroupChat manages the flow of conversation, ensuring that messages are delivered to the intended recipients and that discussions remain coherent and contextually relevant. This section provides detailed instructions and code examples for implementing concurrent multi-expert discussions using the GroupChat feature.\n\n## Setting Up GroupChat\n\nTo set up GroupChat, you need to configure the ChatManager and define the agents that will participate in the discussion. Below is a step-by-step guide with code examples:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Modules\n\nFirst, import the necessary modules from the AutoGen library:\n\n```python\nfrom autogen import GroupChat, ChatManager, Agent\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Agents\n\nCreate instances of the agents that will participate in the GroupChat. Each agent can have unique capabilities, knowledge, and communication styles.\n\n```python\n# Define the agents\nagent1 = Agent(\"Agent1\")\nagent2 = Agent(\"Agent2\")\nagent3 = Agent(\"Agent3\")\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create a GroupChat Instance\n\nInitialize a GroupChat instance with the list of agents:\n\n```python\n# Create a GroupChat instance\ngroup_chat = GroupChat(agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3])\n```\n\n### Step 4: Create a ChatManager Instance\n\nThe ChatManager oversees the conversation, managing message routing, and maintaining the context of the discussion.\n\n```python\n# Create a ChatManager instance\nchat_manager = ChatManager(group_chat=group_chat)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Start the Conversation\n\nStart the conversation by invoking the `start_conversation` method on the ChatManager instance:\n\n```python\n# Start the conversation\nchat_manager.start_conversation()\n```\n\n## Managing Agents\n\nEach agent in the GroupChat can be customized to have unique behaviors and responses. This customization allows for more dynamic and contextually relevant discussions.\n\n### Adding Behaviors to Agents\n\nYou can add behaviors to agents by defining their responses to specific messages or events. For example:\n\n```python\n# Add behaviors to agents\nagent1.add_behavior(\"greet\", lambda: \"Hello, I'm Agent1!\")\nagent2.add_behavior(\"respond\", lambda msg: f\"I received: {msg}\")\nagent3.add_behavior(\"farewell\", lambda: \"Goodbye, I'm Agent3!\")\n```\n\n### Customizing Agent Responses\n\nCustomize agent responses to handle different types of messages or events. This can be done by defining more complex behaviors or by using conditional logic within the behavior functions.\n\n```python\n# Customize agent responses\nagent1.add_behavior(\"handle_message\", lambda msg: f\"Agent1 received: {msg}\")\nagent2.add_behavior(\"handle_message\", lambda msg: f\"Agent2 received: {msg}\")\nagent3.add_behavior(\"handle_message\", lambda msg: f\"Agent3 received: {msg}\")\n```\n\n## Facilitating Discussions\n\nThe ChatManager facilitates discussions by managing the flow of messages and ensuring that the conversation remains coherent. You can send messages through the ChatManager to specific agents or to the entire group.\n\n### Sending Messages\n\nSend messages to specific agents or to the entire group using the `send_message` method:\n\n```python\n# Send messages to specific agents\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent1\", \"greet\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent2\", \"handle_message\", \"Hello, Agent2!\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent3\", \"farewell\")\n```\n\n### Managing Message Flow\n\nThe ChatManager can be configured to manage the flow of messages based on specific rules or policies. For example, you can set up message routing rules to ensure that messages are delivered to the appropriate agents.\n\n```python\n# Configure message routing rules\nchat_manager.add_routing_rule(\"Agent1\", \"Agent2\", lambda msg: \"Agent1 to Agent2: \" + msg)\nchat_manager.add_routing_rule(\"Agent2\", \"Agent3\", lambda msg: \"Agent2 to Agent3: \" + msg)\n```\n\n## Advanced Configuration\n\nFor advanced use cases, you can configure the GroupChat with additional settings, such as message routing rules, context management policies, and more.\n\n### Configuring GroupChat Settings\n\nConfigure the GroupChat with additional settings to enhance its functionality:\n\n```python\n# Configure GroupChat settings\ngroup_chat.set_context_policy(\"strict\")  # Ensure context is strictly maintained\ngroup_chat.set_message_routing(\"dynamic\")  # Use dynamic message routing\n```\n\n### Adding Context Management Policies\n\nAdd context management policies to ensure that the conversation remains coherent and contextually relevant:\n\n```python\n# Add context management policies\ngroup_chat.add_context_policy(\"maintain_history\", True)  # Maintain conversation history\ngroup_chat.add_context_policy(\"context_window\", 10)  # Set context window size\n```\n\n### Implementing Custom Message Handlers\n\nImplement custom message handlers to handle specific types of messages or events:\n\n```python\n# Implement custom message handlers\ndef custom_message_handler(sender, recipient, message):\n    print(f\"Custom handler: {sender} to {recipient}: {message}\")\n\ngroup_chat.add_message_handler(\"custom_handler\", custom_message_handler)\n```\n\n## Example: Complete Implementation\n\nBelow is a complete example of implementing concurrent multi-expert discussions using the GroupChat feature:\n\n```python\nfrom autogen import GroupChat, ChatManager, Agent\n\n# Define the agents\nagent1 = Agent(\"Agent1\")\nagent2 = Agent(\"Agent2\")\nagent3 = Agent(\"Agent3\")\n\n# Add behaviors to agents\nagent1.add_behavior(\"greet\", lambda: \"Hello, I'm Agent1!\")\nagent2.add_behavior(\"respond\", lambda msg: f\"I received: {msg}\")\nagent3.add_behavior(\"farewell\", lambda: \"Goodbye, I'm Agent3!\")\n\n# Create a GroupChat instance\ngroup_chat = GroupChat(agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3])\n\n# Configure GroupChat settings\ngroup_chat.set_context_policy(\"strict\")\ngroup_chat.set_message_routing(\"dynamic\")\n\n# Create a ChatManager instance\nchat_manager = ChatManager(group_chat=group_chat)\n\n# Configure message routing rules\nchat_manager.add_routing_rule(\"Agent1\", \"Agent2\", lambda msg: \"Agent1 to Agent2: \" + msg)\nchat_manager.add_routing_rule(\"Agent2\", \"Agent3\", lambda msg: \"Agent2 to Agent3: \" + msg)\n\n# Start the conversation\nchat_manager.start_conversation()\n\n# Send messages to specific agents\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent1\", \"greet\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent2\", \"respond\", \"Hello, Agent2!\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent3\", \"farewell\")\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe GroupChat feature in AutoGen is a powerful tool for facilitating concurrent, multi-expert discussions. By following the steps and examples provided in this section, you can set up and configure GroupChat to manage complex, real-time conversations among multiple agents.

These modules provide the essential components for creating and managing agents, as well as setting up the GroupChat environment.\n\n```python\nfrom autogen import GroupChat, ChatManager, Agent\n```\n\n- **GroupChat**: This class is used to create a chat room where multiple agents can communicate.\n- **ChatManager**: This class manages the conversation within the GroupChat, ensuring that messages are delivered to the intended recipients.\n- **Agent**: This class represents an individual agent that can participate in the GroupChat.\n\n#### Step 2: Defining Agents\n\nNext, you need to define the agents that will participate in the GroupChat. Each agent can have unique capabilities, knowledge, and communication styles.\n\n```python\n# Define the agents\nagent1 = Agent(\"Agent1\")\nagent2 = Agent(\"Agent2\")\nagent3 = Agent(\"Agent3\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we are creating three agents named `Agent1`, `Agent2`, and `Agent3`. You can customize each agent by adding specific behaviors and responses.\n\n#### Step 3: Customizing Agent Behaviors\n\nYou can customize the agents by defining their behaviors and responses. For example, you can add a greeting behavior to `Agent1` and a response behavior to `Agent2`.\n\n```python\n# Customize agent behaviors\nagent1.add_behavior(\"greet\", lambda: \"Hello, I'm Agent1!\")\nagent2.add_behavior(\"respond\", lambda msg: f\"I received: {msg}\")\n```\n\n- **add_behavior**: This method allows you to add a specific behavior to an agent. The first argument is the name of the behavior, and the second argument is a lambda function that defines the behavior.\n\n#### Step 4: Creating a GroupChat Instance\n\nOnce the agents are defined and customized, you can create a GroupChat instance and add the agents to it.\n\n```python\n# Create a GroupChat instance\ngroup_chat = GroupChat(agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3])\n```\n\n- **GroupChat**: This class initializes a new chat room and takes a list of agents as an argument.\n\n#### Step 5: Creating a ChatManager Instance\n\nThe ChatManager oversees the conversation within the GroupChat. It manages message routing and maintains the context of the discussion.\n\n```python\n# Create a ChatManager instance\nchat_manager = ChatManager(group_chat=group_chat)\n```\n\n- **ChatManager**: This class initializes a new chat manager and takes a GroupChat instance as an argument.\n\n#### Step 6: Starting the Conversation\n\nWith the GroupChat and ChatManager set up, you can start the conversation and facilitate discussions among the agents.\n\n```python\n# Start the conversation\nchat_manager.start_conversation()\n```\n\n- **start_conversation**: This method initiates the conversation within the GroupChat.\n\n#### Step 7: Facilitating Discussions\n\nYou can facilitate discussions by sending messages through the ChatManager. For example, you can send a greeting message from `Agent1` and a response message to `Agent2`.\n\n```python\n# Facilitate discussions\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent1\", \"greet\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent2\", \"respond\", \"Hello, Agent2!\")\n```\n\n- **send_message**: This method sends a message to a specific agent. The first argument is the name of the agent, the second argument is the behavior to invoke, and the third argument (if any) is the message to send.\n\n### Complete Example\n\nHere is the complete code for setting up a basic AutoGen application:\n\n```python\nfrom autogen import GroupChat, ChatManager, Agent\n\n# Define the agents\nagent1 = Agent(\"Agent1\")\nagent2 = Agent(\"Agent2\")\nagent3 = Agent(\"Agent3\")\n\n# Customize agent behaviors\nagent1.add_behavior(\"greet\", lambda: \"Hello, I'm Agent1!\")\nagent2.add_behavior(\"respond\", lambda msg: f\"I received: {msg}\")\n\n# Create a GroupChat instance\ngroup_chat = GroupChat(agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3])\n\n# Create a ChatManager instance\nchat_manager = ChatManager(group_chat=group_chat)\n\n# Start the conversation\nchat_manager.start_conversation()\n\n# Facilitate discussions\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent1\", \"greet\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent2\", \"respond\", \"Hello, Agent2!\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Importing Modules**: The necessary modules are imported to create and manage agents, as well as set up the GroupChat environment.\n- **Defining Agents**: Three agents are created with unique names.\n- **Customizing Agent Behaviors**: Specific behaviors are added to the agents to define their responses.\n- **Creating GroupChat Instance**: A GroupChat instance is created, and the agents are added to it.\n- **Creating ChatManager Instance**: A ChatManager instance is created to oversee the conversation within the GroupChat.\n- **Starting the Conversation**: The conversation within the GroupChat is initiated.\n- **Facilitating Discussions**: Messages are sent to specific agents to facilitate discussions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up a basic AutoGen application and facilitate concurrent, multi-expert discussions using the GroupChat feature."

            "result": "### Setting Up a Basic AutoGen Application\n\nThis section will guide you through the process of setting up a basic AutoGen application, including code examples and detailed explanations.\n\n#### Step 1: Importing Required Modules\n\nFirst, you need to import the necessary modules from the AutoGen library. These modules provide the essential components for creating and managing agents, as well as setting up the GroupChat environment.\n\n```python\nfrom autogen import GroupChat, ChatManager, Agent\n```\n\n- **GroupChat**: This class is used to create a chat room where multiple agents can communicate.\n- **ChatManager**: This class manages the conversation within the GroupChat, ensuring that messages are delivered to the intended recipients.\n- **Agent**: This class represents an individual agent that can participate in the GroupChat.\n\n#### Step 2: Defining Agents\n\nNext, you need to define the agents that will participate in the GroupChat. Each agent can have unique capabilities, knowledge, and communication styles.\n\n```python\n# Define the agents\nagent1 = Agent(\"Agent1\")\nagent2 = Agent(\"Agent2\")\nagent3 = Agent(\"Agent3\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we are creating three agents named `Agent1`, `Agent2`, and `Agent3`. You can customize each agent by adding specific behaviors and responses.\n\n#### Step 3: Customizing Agent Behaviors\n\nYou can customize the agents by defining their behaviors and responses. For example, you can add a greeting behavior to `Agent1` and a response behavior to `Agent2`.\n\n```python\n# Customize agent behaviors\nagent1.add_behavior(\"greet\", lambda: \"Hello, I'm Agent1!\")\nagent2.add_behavior(\"respond\", lambda msg: f\"I received: {msg}\")\n```\n\n- **add_behavior**: This method allows you to add a specific behavior to an agent. The first argument is the name of the behavior, and the second argument is a lambda function that defines the behavior.\n\n#### Step 4: Creating a GroupChat Instance\n\nOnce the agents are defined and customized, you can create a GroupChat instance and add the agents to it.\n\n```python\n# Create a GroupChat instance\ngroup_chat = GroupChat(agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3])\n```\n\n- **GroupChat**: This class initializes a new chat room and takes a list of agents as an argument.\n\n#### Step 5: Creating a ChatManager Instance\n\nThe ChatManager oversees the conversation within the GroupChat. It manages message routing and maintains the context of the discussion.\n\n```python\n# Create a ChatManager instance\nchat_manager = ChatManager(group_chat=group_chat)\n```\n\n- **ChatManager**: This class initializes a new chat manager and takes a GroupChat instance as an argument.\n\n#### Step 6: Starting the Conversation\n\nWith the GroupChat and ChatManager set up, you can start the conversation and facilitate discussions among the agents.\n\n```python\n# Start the conversation\nchat_manager.start_conversation()\n```\n\n- **start_conversation**: This method initiates the conversation within the GroupChat.\n\n#### Step 7: Facilitating Discussions\n\nYou can facilitate discussions by sending messages through the ChatManager. For example, you can send a greeting message from `Agent1` and a response message to `Agent2`.\n\n```python\n# Facilitate discussions\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent1\", \"greet\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent2\", \"respond\", \"Hello, Agent2!\")\n```\n\n- **send_message**: This method sends a message to a specific agent. The first argument is the name of the agent, the second argument is the behavior to invoke, and the third argument (if any) is the message to send.\n\n### Complete Example\n\nHere is the complete code for setting up a basic AutoGen application:\n\n```python\nfrom autogen import GroupChat, ChatManager, Agent\n\n# Define the agents\nagent1 = Agent(\"Agent1\")\nagent2 = Agent(\"Agent2\")\nagent3 = Agent(\"Agent3\")\n\n# Customize agent behaviors\nagent1.add_behavior(\"greet\", lambda: \"Hello, I'm Agent1!\")\nagent2.add_behavior(\"respond\", lambda msg: f\"I received: {msg}\")\n\n# Create a GroupChat instance\ngroup_chat = GroupChat(agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3])\n\n# Create a ChatManager instance\nchat_manager = ChatManager(group_chat=group_chat)\n\n# Start the conversation\nchat_manager.start_conversation()\n\n# Facilitate discussions\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent1\", \"greet\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent2\", \"respond\", \"Hello, Agent2!\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Importing Modules**: The necessary modules are imported to create and manage agents, as well as set up the GroupChat environment.\n- **Defining Agents**: Three agents are created with unique names.\n- **Customizing Agent Behaviors**: Specific behaviors are added to the agents to define their responses.\n- **Creating GroupChat Instance**: A GroupChat instance is created, and the agents are added to it.\n- **Creating ChatManager Instance**: A ChatManager instance is created to oversee the conversation within the GroupChat.\n- **Starting the Conversation**: The conversation within the GroupChat is initiated.\n- **Facilitating Discussions**: Messages are sent to specific agents to facilitate discussions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up a basic AutoGen application and facilitate concurrent, multi-expert discussions using the GroupChat feature."

            "result": "# Implementing Concurrent Multi-Expert Discussions Using GroupChat\n\n## Overview of GroupChat\n\nThe GroupChat feature in AutoGen is designed to facilitate concurrent discussions among multiple agents, enabling collaborative problem-solving, decision-making, and brainstorming. GroupChat manages the flow of conversation, ensuring that messages are delivered to the intended recipients and that discussions remain coherent and contextually relevant. This section provides detailed instructions and code examples for implementing concurrent multi-expert discussions using the GroupChat feature.\n\n## Setting Up GroupChat\n\nTo set up GroupChat, you need to configure the ChatManager and define the agents that will participate in the discussion. Below is a step-by-step guide with code examples:\n\n### Step 1: Import Necessary Modules\n\nFirst, import the necessary modules from the AutoGen library:\n\n```python\nfrom autogen import GroupChat, ChatManager, Agent\n```\n\n### Step 2: Define the Agents\n\nCreate instances of the agents that will participate in the GroupChat. Each agent can have unique capabilities, knowledge, and communication styles.\n\n```python\n# Define the agents\nagent1 = Agent(\"Agent1\")\nagent2 = Agent(\"Agent2\")\nagent3 = Agent(\"Agent3\")\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create a GroupChat Instance\n\nInitialize a GroupChat instance with the list of agents:\n\n```python\n# Create a GroupChat instance\ngroup_chat = GroupChat(agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3])\n```\n\n### Step 4: Create a ChatManager Instance\n\nThe ChatManager oversees the conversation, managing message routing, and maintaining the context of the discussion.\n\n```python\n# Create a ChatManager instance\nchat_manager = ChatManager(group_chat=group_chat)\n```\n\n### Step 5: Start the Conversation\n\nStart the conversation by invoking the `start_conversation` method on the ChatManager instance:\n\n```python\n# Start the conversation\nchat_manager.start_conversation()\n```\n\n## Managing Agents\n\nEach agent in the GroupChat can be customized to have unique behaviors and responses. This customization allows for more dynamic and contextually relevant discussions.\n\n### Adding Behaviors to Agents\n\nYou can add behaviors to agents by defining their responses to specific messages or events. For example:\n\n```python\n# Add behaviors to agents\nagent1.add_behavior(\"greet\", lambda: \"Hello, I'm Agent1!\")\nagent2.add_behavior(\"respond\", lambda msg: f\"I received: {msg}\")\nagent3.add_behavior(\"farewell\", lambda: \"Goodbye, I'm Agent3!\")\n```\n\n### Customizing Agent Responses\n\nCustomize agent responses to handle different types of messages or events. This can be done by defining more complex behaviors or by using conditional logic within the behavior functions.\n\n```python\n# Customize agent responses\nagent1.add_behavior(\"handle_message\", lambda msg: f\"Agent1 received: {msg}\")\nagent2.add_behavior(\"handle_message\", lambda msg: f\"Agent2 received: {msg}\")\nagent3.add_behavior(\"handle_message\", lambda msg: f\"Agent3 received: {msg}\")\n```\n\n## Facilitating Discussions\n\nThe ChatManager facilitates discussions by managing the flow of messages and ensuring that the conversation remains coherent. You can send messages through the ChatManager to specific agents or to the entire group.\n\n### Sending Messages\n\nSend messages to specific agents or to the entire group using the `send_message` method:\n\n```python\n# Send messages to specific agents\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent1\", \"greet\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent2\", \"handle_message\", \"Hello, Agent2!\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent3\", \"farewell\")\n```\n\n### Managing Message Flow\n\nThe ChatManager can be configured to manage the flow of messages based on specific rules or policies. For example, you can set up message routing rules to ensure that messages are delivered to the appropriate agents.\n\n```python\n# Configure message routing rules\nchat_manager.add_routing_rule(\"Agent1\", \"Agent2\", lambda msg: \"Agent1 to Agent2: \" + msg)\nchat_manager.add_routing_rule(\"Agent2\", \"Agent3\", lambda msg: \"Agent2 to Agent3: \" + msg)\n```\n\n## Advanced Configuration\n\nFor advanced use cases, you can configure the GroupChat with additional settings, such as message routing rules, context management policies, and more.\n\n### Configuring GroupChat Settings\n\nConfigure the GroupChat with additional settings to enhance its functionality:\n\n```python\n# Configure GroupChat settings\ngroup_chat.set_context_policy(\"strict\")  # Ensure context is strictly maintained\ngroup_chat.set_message_routing(\"dynamic\")  # Use dynamic message routing\n```\n\n### Adding Context Management Policies\n\nAdd context management policies to ensure that the conversation remains coherent and contextually relevant:\n\n```python\n# Add context management policies\ngroup_chat.add_context_policy(\"maintain_history\", True)  # Maintain conversation history\ngroup_chat.add_context_policy(\"context_window\", 10)  # Set context window size\n```\n\n### Implementing Custom Message Handlers\n\nImplement custom message handlers to handle specific types of messages or events:\n\n```python\n# Implement custom message handlers\ndef custom_message_handler(sender, recipient, message):\n    print(f\"Custom handler: {sender} to {recipient}: {message}\")\n\ngroup_chat.add_message_handler(\"custom_handler\", custom_message_handler)\n```\n\n## Example: Complete Implementation\n\nBelow is a complete example of implementing concurrent multi-expert discussions using the GroupChat feature:\n\n```python\nfrom autogen import GroupChat, ChatManager, Agent\n\n# Define the agents\nagent1 = Agent(\"Agent1\")\nagent2 = Agent(\"Agent2\")\nagent3 = Agent(\"Agent3\")\n\n# Add behaviors to agents\nagent1.add_behavior(\"greet\", lambda: \"Hello, I'm Agent1!\")\nagent2.add_behavior(\"respond\", lambda msg: f\"I received: {msg}\")\nagent3.add_behavior(\"farewell\", lambda: \"Goodbye, I'm Agent3!\")\n\n# Create a GroupChat instance\ngroup_chat = GroupChat(agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3])\n\n# Configure GroupChat settings\ngroup_chat.set_context_policy(\"strict\")\ngroup_chat.set_message_routing(\"dynamic\")\n\n# Create a ChatManager instance\nchat_manager = ChatManager(group_chat=group_chat)\n\n# Configure message routing rules\nchat_manager.add_routing_rule(\"Agent1\", \"Agent2\", lambda msg: \"Agent1 to Agent2: \" + msg)\nchat_manager.add_routing_rule(\"Agent2\", \"Agent3\", lambda msg: \"Agent2 to Agent3: \" + msg)\n\n# Start the conversation\nchat_manager.start_conversation()\n\n# Send messages to specific agents\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent1\", \"greet\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent2\", \"respond\", \"Hello, Agent2!\")\nchat_manager.send_message(\"Agent3\", \"farewell\")\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe GroupChat feature in AutoGen is a powerful tool for facilitating concurrent, multi-expert discussions. By following the steps and examples provided in this section, you can set up and configure GroupChat to manage complex, real-time conversations among multiple agents.
