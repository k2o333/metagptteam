# Fixes Summary for Hierarchical Document Generation Issues

## Issue 1: Research Action Tool Calling Mechanism

### Problem
The Research action sometimes couldn't call tools properly and needed a more robust mechanism for:
1. Configuring tool lists in local_config.yaml
2. Handling single task experience
3. Managing document RAG
4. Implementing persistent experience pool
5. Retrying tool calls with different models when they fail

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Configuration Updates
- **File**: `/root/metagpt/mghier/configs/local_config.yaml`
- Added `retry_config` section under `research` configuration with:
  - `max_retry_attempts`: 3
  - `retry_models`: List of models to try in sequence

#### 2. Code Modifications

**a. Research Model Updates**
- **File**: `/root/metagpt/mghier/hierarchical/actions/research_model.py`
- Added `tool_retry_config` field to `ResearchConfig` class
- Added default tool configuration with MCP tools and builtin tools

**b. Research Service Updates**
- **File**: `/root/metagpt/mghier/hierarchical/actions/research_service.py`
- Modified `ToolExecutionService.__init__` to read retry configuration
- Updated `execute_tool` method to implement retry mechanism with multiple attempts
- Added proper error handling and logging for failed tool executions

**c. Research Controller Updates**
- **File**: `/root/metagpt/mghier/hierarchical/actions/research_controller.py`
- Modified `ResearchController.__init__` to load tool retry configuration from local_config.yaml
- Updated `_parse_tool_descriptions` method to fallback to configuration-based tool list
- Enhanced tool execution flow to support retry mechanism

#### 3. Features Implemented
- **Tool List Configuration**: Tools are now configurable in local_config.yaml
- **Model Retry Mechanism**: When a tool call fails, the system automatically tries different models
- **Persistent Experience Pool**: Configuration supports experience pool with read/write capabilities
- **Document RAG Integration**: Internal RAG service integrated for document search
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed logging

## Issue 2: Multiple Output Files Generation

### Problem
The system was generating multiple output files instead of just one final document.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Run Hierarchical Script Updates
- **File**: `/root/metagpt/mghier/scripts/run_hierarchical.py`
- Added `from datetime import datetime` import
- Modified the forced archiving logic to use the same filename format as the Archiver role
- Changed timestamp generation to use `datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")` instead of hardcoded "final_forced"
- Ensured only one final document is generated per run

#### 2. Archiver Role Consistency
- **File**: `/root/metagpt/mghier/hierarchical/roles/archiver.py`
- Maintained existing filename generation logic for consistency
- Both normal archiving and forced archiving now use the same timestamp format

## Testing

### Test Script
- Created `/root/metagpt/mghier/test_fixes.py` to verify both fixes
- Tests include:
  1. Research configuration and retry mechanism
  2. Single output file generation
  3. Research action improvements

### Test Results
- All tests passed successfully
- ResearchConfig properly loads tool retry configuration
- ToolExecutionService correctly implements retry mechanism
- Configuration files properly updated with retry_config
- Output file generation follows consistent naming pattern

## Compliance with Rules

All changes comply with the project rules:
- Only modified files within the project code directory (`/root/metagpt/mghier`)
- No external file modifications
- Followed existing code patterns and conventions
- Maintained backward compatibility

## Summary

The implemented fixes address both issues effectively:

1. **Research Action Tool Calling**: Enhanced with configurable tool lists, retry mechanisms, and persistent experience pool
2. **Single Output File**: Ensured only one final document is generated per run with consistent naming

The solution is robust, maintainable, and follows the existing architecture patterns of the project.
